> A mobile app that translates sign language into speech, making communication easier for sign language users.
>
> SignSpeak aims to bridge the communication gap by providing a user-friendly platform that translates sign language into spoken words in real-time. We believe in enhancing accessibility and ensuring effective communication.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to sign into the app, so I can start translating my signs into speech.
- As a user, I want to customize my settings, so I can choose my preferred language and voice.
- As a user, I want to receive real-time notifications, so I can stay informed about my translations.

###  SignSpeak is built using the following technologies:

    - This project leverages the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/), a versatile platform enabling cross-platform app development with a single codebase for mobile, desktop, and web applications.
    - For data persistence, the app utilizes the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package, allowing the creation of a custom storage schema and saving data to a local database.
    - To handle local push notifications, the app employs the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package, which is compatible with Android, iOS, and macOS.
    - ðŸš¨ Note: Notifications on macOS are currently non-functional due to a known issue we're actively addressing!
    - The app features the ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) font as its primary typeface and follows material design guidelines throughout its user interface.
